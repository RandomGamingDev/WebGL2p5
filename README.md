# WebGL2p5
A simple library that replaces the classic WebGL 1 of p5.js (only required if you're using a version older than 1.7.0) with WebGL2

Simply include it after including the p5.js library and it'll replace the WebGL 1 initialization code with WebGL 2 initialization code allowing you to use WebGL 2 features while p5.js can continue to use WebGL features due to how similar the WebGL 1 & WebGL 2 APIs are.

To use it you can simply include https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/WebGL2p5/webgl2p5.js in your HTML file! If you want to you can also just download the file and include it in your HTML file that way.

btw stuff updates so remember to specify a version/commit for your library if you want to use a link and don't want your code to automatically update to the newest version of the library
